You and me hanging from the willow tree
Quietly drifting in the open breeze
Suddenly the wind blows you away from me
Now I see we were never meant to be
If only we could travel back in time (whoa)
Right where we belong
Maybe we'll never need a reason why (whoa)
We danced until the dawn
If only we could travel back in time (whoa)
Right where we belong
Maybe we'll never need a reason why (whoa)
We danced until the dawn
We danced until the dawn
You and me born from the same branch and leaves
Wild and free, living here in harmony
Don't you see this is where you want to be
But when you leave the world is never what it seems
If only we could travel back in time (whoa)
Right where we belong
Maybe we'll never need a reason why (whoa)
We danced until the dawn
If only we could travel back in time (whoa)
Right where we belong
Maybe we'll never need a reason why (whoa)
We danced until the dawn
We danced until the dawn
You and me hanging from the willow tree
Quietly drifting in the open breeze
You and me hanging from the willow tree
Quietly drifting in the open breeze
