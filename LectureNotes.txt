we have some process with the inlet x(t) and the outlet y(t)
x(t) = forcing function distrubance. Set point change
y(t) = process response

We define X(t) = x(t) - x(ss)

We must now do a laplace transformation.
X(s) -> model Gp(s) -> Y(s)
X(s) = alpha[x(t)-x(ss)]
Y(s) = alpha[y(t)-y(ss)]
Gp(s) = Process Transfer Function
Y(s) = Gp(s)*X(s)

In chemical engineering, all transport functions have the following form:
Gp(s) = ((alpha0 + alpha1*s)/(Beta0 + Beta1*s + Beta2s*^2))*e^(-s*theta)

Properties of Transfer functions:
1. Addititve (x(s))

2. Functions in series (like two tanks in series)
Example: x(s) -> Gp1(s) -> Y1(s) -> Gp2(s) -> Y(s)
Composite transfer function: Gp1(s)Gp2(s)

3. Functions in parallel

Derication of Transfer Functions:
* Derivations based on first principles (classroom content) for linear systems
* Derivations based on first principles via linearization of nonlinear systems (most functions are nonlinear for chemical engineering applications)
* We perform tests in the actual opering unit and derive the reaction curve. These tests are called step tests or bump tests
